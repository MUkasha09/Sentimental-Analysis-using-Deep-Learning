# Optimizing Sentiment Classification with Next-Gen AI: Enhancing Accuracy and Interpretability

## Project Overview

This project aims to conduct a systematic comparison of various transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLNet, ALBERT) for sentiment analysis tasks. The focus is on fine-tuning strategies and their impact on performance, efficiency, and generalizability across different datasets.

## Key Objectives

1. **Model Comparison** : Evaluate and compare the performance of multiple transformer-based models on sentiment classification tasks.
2. **Fine-tuning Strategy Analysis** : Assess different fine-tuning approaches (standard fine-tuning, gradual unfreezing, layer freezing) to determine their effect on model performance.
3. **Efficiency Evaluation** : Analyze the trade-offs between model size, computational requirements, and accuracy to provide insights for real-world applications.
4. **Cross-Domain Generalization** : Test models across various domains (social media, product reviews, etc.) to evaluate their robustness and transferability.
5. **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework** : Develop a methodology for systematically comparing transformer models that considers both performance metrics and practical implementation concerns.

   Through this research, we aim to provide practical guidelines for selecting appropriate transformer models and fine-tuning strategies for sentiment analysis applications, helping practitioners make informed decisions based on their specific requirements and constraints.
